## Week 12

### What we accompished/discovered

This week we focused on refining our design/sketches. We finished an onshape design for the main back piece of our project, as well as a prototype for the front piece. We also made sketches for these pieces which will act as a blue print once we start building. We also contacted our UVA Mentor, Nicholas, to schedule a meeting and mull over ideas. We decided the frame design we are going with, and our design for the front attatchment piece. 

One issue we've ran into is how we will secure the front wheel of our bike in a stable and efficent fasion. Originally we had the idea to use a spring powered snap fit device to hold in the wheel, but Mr. Miller helped us realize this wouldn't work well because any movement of the bike would destablilize this. We also thought about a screw powered tightening device, but this also seemed like excsessive hassle. We landed on a design involving a 3 3D printed piece's that will hold different bike tire sizes with a perepidicular wall that will have a slot for the bike wheels. 

One thing that went well was our brainstorming. We were able to finalize a desgin that will allow us to build our protoytype next week. We struggled with staying on task 100% of the time,

### Future plans

Next week we plan to start building our prototype. We will build the frame of the back piece out of wood, 3D print the neccesary parts of the front piece, and then build the front pieces frame out of wood. We intend to finsish this intial protype next week, and move onto building the generator piece of our project.
